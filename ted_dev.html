        <h2>TED - Development</h2>
        <p>
            Ted is in active development. It was programmed in Go language using the termbox-go text-based user interface library.
        </p>
        <p>
            I needed a simple textbox control for another project, and in the process of creating one, I realized that the control could be best tested as a proof of concept by embedding in a standalone text editor program. And that's how the development of Ted got started.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future functionality to be added: (a) Undo/Redo, (b) Multi-File editing, (c) Split Windows. A graphical and web version would also be nice.
        </p>
        <p>
        The complete source code is available on <a href="http://github.com/robdelacruz/ted">github</a>. The bulk of the functionality can be found in <a href="https://github.com/robdelacruz/ted/blob/master/buf.go">buf.go</a> (buffer) and <a href="https://github.com/robdelacruz/ted/blob/master/editview.go">editview.go</a> (edit control). Source code is under MIT License so it can be used freely in all commercial and non-commercial projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ted can be used in schools as a resource for teaching basic data structures and how to develop a basic text editor from scratch.
