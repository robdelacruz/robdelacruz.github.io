        <h2>TED - Development</h2>
        <p>
            I needed a simple textbox control for another project so I decided to create one using the termbox-go textmode user interface library. The 'editview' control is the central component of the TED text editor.
        </p>
        <p>
            TED only has very basic functionality. Currently, you can select, copy and paste text, do search, and open and save UTF-8 text files. In the future, if I have time, I would like to add more sophisticated functionality such as (a) Undo/Redo, (b) Multi-File editing, (c) Split Windows. A graphical and web version would also be nice.
        </p>
        <p>
        The complete source code is available on <a href="http://github.com/robdelacruz/ted">github</a>. The bulk of the functionality can be found in <a href="https://github.com/robdelacruz/ted/blob/master/buf.go">buf.go</a> (buffer) and <a href="https://github.com/robdelacruz/ted/blob/master/editview.go">editview.go</a> (edit control).

        <p>
            Ted can be used in schools as a resource for teaching basic data structures and how to develop a basic text editor from scratch.
